      <h1>Expenses</h1>
      <p>Imagine purchasing a cup of coffee in New York City. In 2000, this would have cost about one dollar. Today, expect to pay five dollars. This significant price increase is indicative of the broader rise in New York City's cost of living, which is now 30% higher than the average of other states. Specifically, housing costs are 78% higher than the national average. Utilities exceed the average by 4%, and everyday items like groceries and clothing are about 12% more expensive. The living expenses for a single person estimated monthly cost is $1553 without rent and mortgage, while for a family of four the estimated monthly cost is $5,720 without rent and mortgage.
